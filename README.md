In Armenian we have a wonderful word "bzbzal" (բզբզալ), I don't know the origin, but I've decided that it originates from the sound of a bee - bzzzz. Bzbzal means to do some small work, just play around something, not super impactful, but still useful.

This repo is a collection of my bzbzals - it's staff that is not worth a separate repo, but I may still need to store it / share it / have version control. 

As a rule of thumb, the codes are super low quality, not tested, not documented. 

Have fun!
